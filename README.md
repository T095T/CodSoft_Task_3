## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing credit card transactions. The dataset is anonymized and consists of features derived from transaction details. Due to privacy concerns, raw transaction information is not disclosed.

## Model Architecture

The fraud detection model is built using [Logistic Regression], and the architecture includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features and transform the data to improve model performance.

3. **Model Training:** Utilize a machine learning algorithm (e.g.Logistic Regression) to train the model on the labeled dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. Conduct cross-validation to ensure robustness.
